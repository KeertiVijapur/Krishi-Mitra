AgriBot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist farmers by providing **real-time agricultural support**, **personalized crop recommendations**, and **plant disease prediction** using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## ✨ Features
* 💬 **AI Chatbot** – Answers farmer queries instantly using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
* 🌱 **Crop Recommendation** – Suggests the most suitable crops based on soil parameters (pH, nutrients, moisture).
* 🩺 **Disease Prediction** – Identifies plant diseases from uploaded images using deep learning models.
* 📊 **Data-Driven Decisions** – Uses soil and weather data for accurate insights.
* 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple web or mobile interface for farmers.
